      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring programmer/web developer, and I am currently enrolled in the UC Davis coding bootcamp.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Manteca, CA.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Petting dogs, video games, spending time with friends, petting dogs, board games, and music. And petting dogs.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>One that allows me to use my brain, troubleshoot, work from home, not be bombarded nonstop by strangers (retail experience taught 
        me that), have a level of control and responsibility, and create things others can admire and be benefited by.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Sacramento, CA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It fits what I see myself needing/wanting in a "dream job," like I outlined above. There is some flexibility, and there's 
        always something to fix or create. There's also a challenge that forbids boredom.
